# 1 The Real and Complex Number Systems


### 1. If $r$ is rational ($r \ne 0$) and $x$ is irrational, prove that $r+x$ and $rx$ are irrational.

If there is any $rx$ be rational, we could write $rx = p/q$, $r = m/n$ where $p$, $q$, $m$, $n$ are integers. Then $rx = x*m/n = p/q$ means $x = \frac {pn} {qm}$. It is contrary to that $x$ is irrational. We now proved that $rx$ are irrational.

If there is any $r+x$ be rational, we could write $r+x = p/q$, $r=m/n$ where $p$, $q$, $m$, $n$ are integers. Then $r+x = m/n + x = p/q$ means $x = \frac {np - mq} {nq}$. It is contrary to that $x$ is irational. We now proved that $r+x$ are irrational.
