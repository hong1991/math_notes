# Week 1

**Definition.** A *vector space* is any collection *V* of objects (called *vectors*) for which two operations can be performed:

- *Vector addition*, whichtakes two vectors *v* and *w* in *V* and returns another vector *v* + *w* in *V*. (Thus *V* must be closed under addition).

- *Scalar multiplication*, which takes a scalar *c* in **R** and a vector *v* in *V*, and returns another vector *cv* in *V*. (Thus *V* must be closed under scalar multiplication).

Futhermore, for *V* to be a vector space, the following properties must be satisfied:

1. (Addtion is commutative) For all *v*, *w* $\in$ *V*, *v*+*w* = *w*+*v*.

2. (Addition is associative) For all *u*, *v*, *w* $\in$ *V*, *u*+(*v*+*w*) = (*u*+*v*)+*w*.

3. (Additive identity) There is a vector 0 $\in$ *V*, called the *zero vector*, such that 0+*v* = *v*.

4. (Additive inverse) For each vector *v* $\in$ *V*, there is a vector -*v* $\in$ *V*, called the *addtive inverse* of *v*, such that -*v*+*v* = 0.

5. (Multiplicative identity) The scalar 1 has the property that 1*v* = *v* for all *v* $\in$ *V*.

6. (Multiplication is assosiative) For any scalars *a*, *b* $\in$ **R** and any vector *v* $\in$ *V*, we have *a* (*b* *v*) = (*a* *b*) *v*.

7. (Muliplication is linear) For any scalar *a* $\in$ **R** and any vectors *v*, *w* $\in$ *V*, we have *a* (*v*+*w*) = *a* *v* + *a* *w*.

8. (Muliplication distributes over addtition) For any scalars *a*, *b* $\in$ **R** and any vector *v* $\in$ *V*, we have (*a*+*b*) *v* = *a* *v* + *b* *v*.
